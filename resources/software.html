                    <p>
                        An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. Most modern IDEs have an intelligent code completion.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Pycharm</h3>
                    <p>
                        PyCharm is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for programming in Python. It provides code analysis, a graphical debugger, an integrated unit tester, integration with version control systems (VCSes), and supports web development with Django. PyCharm is developed by the Czech company JetBrains.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> It is cross-platform working on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. PyCharm has a Professional Edition, released under a proprietary license and a Community Edition released under the Apache License.[3] PyCharm Community Edition is less extensive than the Professional Edition.

                    <h3>Eclipse</h3>
                    <p>
                        In computer programming, Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE). It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. Eclipse is written mostly in Java and its primary use is for developing Java applications, but it may also be used to develop applications in other programming languages through the use of plugins, including: Ada, ABAP, C, C++, COBOL, Fortran, Haskell, JavaScript, Lasso, Lua, NATURAL, Perl, PHP, Prolog, Python, R, Ruby (including Ruby on Rails framework), Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Scheme, and Erlang. It can also be used to develop packages for the software Mathematica. Development environments include the Eclipse Java development tools (JDT) for Java and Scala, Eclipse CDT for C/C++ and Eclipse PDT for PHP, among others.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> The initial codebase originated from IBM VisualAge. The Eclipse software development kit (SDK), which includes the Java development tools, is meant for Java developers. Users can extend its abilities by installing plug-ins written for the Eclipse Platform, such as development toolkits for other programming languages, and can write and contribute their own plug-in modules.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> Released under the terms of the Eclipse Public License, Eclipse SDK is free and open-source software (although it is incompatible with the GNU General Public License). It was one of the first IDEs to run under GNU Classpath and it runs without problems under IcedTea.

                    <h2 id="cad">Computer Aided Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        Computer-aided design (CAD) is the use of computer systems to aid in the creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a design. CAD software is used to increase the productivity of the designer, improve the quality of design, improve communications through documentation, and to create a database for manufacturing. CAD output is often in the form of electronic files for print, machining, or other manufacturing operations.
                    </p>
                    <h3>AutoCad</h3>
                    <p>
                        AutoCAD is a commercial software application for 2D and 3D computer-aided design (CAD) and drafting — available since 1982 as a desktop application and since 2010 as a mobile web- and cloud-based app marketed as AutoCAD 360.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> Developed and marketed by Autodesk, AutoCAD was first released in December 1982, running on microcomputers with internal graphics controllers. Prior to the introduction of AutoCAD, most commercial CAD programs ran on mainframe computers or minicomputers, with each CAD operator (user) working at a separate graphics terminal.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> AutoCAD is used across a wide range of industries, by architects, project managers, engineers, graphic designers, and other professionals. It is supported by 750 training centers worldwide as of 1994.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> As Autodesk's flagship product, by March 1986 AutoCAD had become the most ubiquitous CAD program worldwide.

                    <h3>FreeCad</h3>
                    <p>
                        FreeCAD is a free and open-source (under the LGPLv2+ license) general-purpose parametric 3D CAD modeler. FreeCAD is aimed directly at mechanical engineering and product design but also fits in a wider range of uses around engineering, such as architecture or other engineering specialities. FreeCAD is currently in a beta stage of development.

                    <p>
                        Text editors are very handy for a variety of tasks. They do not take as much time to load when compared to a full on IDE, they are light weight, and there are a ton of them to choose from. The few listed here are the ones preffered by the club. Keep in mind that editors like text edit and notepad are not included because they are built in apps for OSX and Windows. The ones listed below are for download across all operating systems.

                    <p>
                        Brackets is a free open-source editor written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a primary focus on Web Development. It was created by Adobe Systems, licensed under the MIT License, and is currently maintained on GitHub. Brackets is available for cross-platform download on Mac, Windows, and Linux.
                        <br/>
